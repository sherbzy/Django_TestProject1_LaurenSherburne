# Django_TestProject1_LaurenSherburne
I just want to see if I can get learn how to use django on my own so...here goes! In this project, I am following along with the tutorial from
the django documentation: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/intro/



My Notes:
 - Run using the command 'python manage.py runserver' in cmd terminal (make sure you're in /Django_TestProject1/mysite otherwise you won't be able to access manage.py)
 - The 3 steps for making model changes:
    (1) Change your models (in models.py)
    (2) Run python manage.py makemigrations to create migrations for those changes
    (3) Run python manage.py migrate to apply those changes to the database
